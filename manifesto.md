## The Civic Hacks Toolkit Manifesto

We the technology people hold a unique power in our hands. The power to self-organize, systemize and scale organizations to levels never before witnessed  by human kind. On the other hand, in todays’ world of crisis, people are rapidly realizing how the governments are failing to address what matters to our local daily lives. We witness a massive participation in the civic commons and an ever increasing appetite to offer back to the community. People today have a true determination to make a change no matter how small it is.

Our role as the technology experts is to facilitate and empower this movement. Provide the tools, methodologies and know-how that until now are only available to us and our beloved paying customers. We have to work closely with our local communities, reach out to all available resources and provide existing, battle tested tools, that will amplify the efforts of this bottom-up movement of the citizens of the city.

This is not about writing software (although that’s also an option as a last resort). This is about leveraging existing technologies to empower the local communities with what we take for granted. This is about a determined group of technologists, who believe they can change the daily life of their fellow citizens just by creating a google group.

This is about treating the local citizen as we would our customer. Give them the best User Experience there is, eye candy services that produce joy and happiness merely by consuming them. Provide smart tools and the gist of information that’s required, abstracting away all the intricacies and pain of having to deal with the government.

We the technology people need to come together, figure out the most optimal ways to self-organize and start working with our local communities. Propagating our knowledge, our tools and know-how. Share the power that we hold, leveraging existing technologies for the benefit of all. 

This is the time we make a difference for ourselves.
