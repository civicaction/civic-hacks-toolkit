# Tools and Libraries

A list of tools & libraries that relate to our mission.

## Big Data

* [d3js.org](http://d3js.org/) **Data-Driven Documents** D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
* [dat-data.org](http://dat-data.com/) **data package management** dat is an open source tool that enables the sharing of large datasets, the goal being a collaboration flow similar to what git offers for source code. **Still in Alpha, started Jun 2013**
